# Software Development Tutorial "Money-Burned"

## About

**"Money-Burned"** is a pool of examples that should serve as a starting point for everyone who wants to develop an application from scratch in various target environments using different frameworks and technologies.  
The background of **"Money-Burned"** is trying to answer the question of the comparability of different technological approaches when selecting a tech stack for specific requirements.  

**"Money-Burned"** is somewhat ambiguous here. On the one hand, the name refers to the basic requirements that we want to implement in our various technology-specific examples. The result should always be a simple tool that makes the loss of time and money through knowledge of the resources used visible. On the other hand, it is a humorous allusion to the amount of time that is often pointlessly wasted trying to find a suitable entry point for a new project.  

## How do I start?

Perhaps you simply choose one of the frameworks or programming languages you are already familiar with. Maybe you choose one, you'd like to get familiar with. Or, if none are available, simply choose one of your preferred operating system.  
All sample repositories should come with a description of the chosen development concept, design considerations and a simple explanation of how to run the application.
